## What is March Madness and what's the problem?
March Madness is just around the corner, and it is one of the biggest annual sporting events in the US. Every year, 68 college basketball teams face off in a high-stakes, knock-out tournament to claim the title of NCAA Men’s Division I champion. What makes it so thrilling is that no one really knows who will get the trophy.

So, what influences the public picks? It’s usually a mix of things: past performances, current season form, and, of course, public sentiment. In this analysis, we can dig into how teams' past achievements and their current season's results shape the predictions for 2024.

```{r Load data}

public_picks <- read_csv("data/public_picks.csv")
ratings <- read_csv("data/538Ratings.csv")
index <- read_csv("data/Heat_Check_Tournament_Index.csv")
```

## Where the data comes from?

I got the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishaanamin/march-madness-data/). To keep it simple and efficient, I only focused on three datasets, "538Ratings", "public_picks", and "Heat_Check_Tournament_Index". To make the data easier, I joined "public_picks" and "Tournament_Index" into one datasets called "index_picks". What's more, I removed special symbols like percentage signs and spaces in 'FINALS' and converted it into numeric. After that, I kept several variables that might be useful for visualizations and analysis, also, I filter the records after year 2016 to keep the time period same. 


```{r}
public_picks <- public_picks |>
  select(TEAMNO,FINALS)

index <- index |>
  rename(TEAMNO = `TEAM NO`)

index_picks <- index |>
  left_join(public_picks, by = "TEAMNO")


# Remove any extraneous characters (e.g., percentage signs, spaces)
index_picks$FINALS <- gsub("%", "", index_picks$FINALS)  # Remove percentage signs
index_picks$FINALS <- gsub(" ", "", index_picks$FINALS)  # Remove spaces


# Convert FINALS to numeric
index_picks$FINALS <- as.numeric(index_picks$FINALS)

#Select variable
index_picks <- index_picks |>
  select(YEAR,TEAMNO,TEAM,SEED,ROUND,POWER,FINALS) |>
  filter(YEAR >= 2016)
```

There are seven variables in the dataset "index_picks". They are 'YEAR', 'TEAMNO', 'TEAM', 'SEED', 'ROUND'




```{r Methods}
#| echo: false
final_round <- index_picks |>
  arrange(desc(FINALS)) |>
  select(TEAM,FINALS) |>
  head(8)


public_picks_final <- index_picks |>
  filter(FINALS %in% final_round$FINALS) |>
  arrange(desc(FINALS))


ratings_top8 <- ratings |>
  filter(TEAM %in% public_picks_final$TEAM)

```

```{r Main Results}
#| label: tbl-finalpick
#| tbl-cap: Public picks in Finals in 2024
#| echo: false
final_round$FINALS <- paste0(final_round$FINALS, "%")

final_round |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling()
```
