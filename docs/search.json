    "text": "March Madness is just around the corner, and it is one of the biggest annual sporting events in the US. Every year, 68 college basketball teams face off in a high-stakes, knock-out tournament to claim the title of NCAA Men’s Division I champion. What makes it so thrilling is that no one really knows who will get the trophy.\nSo, what influences the public picks? It’s usually a mix of things: past performances, current season form, and, of course, public sentiment. In this analysis, we can dig into how teams’ past achievements and their current season’s results shape the predictions for 2024."
